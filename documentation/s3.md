# AWS S3 Configuration Documentation

## **Overview**
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable, high-speed, web-based cloud storage service. This document outlines the configuration and security settings applied to the S3 bucket used in the Kooben project. The implementation follows AWS security best practices, and some features were added based on **tfsec recommendations**.

## **Customer-Managed KMS Key for S3 Encryption**
To enhance security, a **Customer-Managed AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key** is used to encrypt objects stored in the S3 bucket. This provides better control over encryption keys and access permissions.

```hcl
resource "aws_kms_key" "kooben_storage_kms" {
  description             = "KMS key for encrypting the storage bucket"
  deletion_window_in_days = 10
  enable_key_rotation     = true
}
```

## **General Storage Bucket**
A dedicated S3 bucket is created to store project-related data.

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "kooben_storage_bucket" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
}
```

## **Blocking Public Access** *(tfsec recommendation)*
To prevent unauthorized access, all public access is blocked for the S3 bucket.

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "kooben_storage_bucket" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.kooben_storage_bucket.id

  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}
```

## **Enabling Server-Side Encryption** *(tfsec recommendation)*
All objects in the S3 bucket are encrypted using **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)** to enhance data security.

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "kooben_storage_bucket" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.kooben_storage_bucket.id

  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
      kms_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.kooben_storage_kms.arn
    }
  }
}
```

## **Enabling Versioning** *(tfsec recommendation)*
To track changes and prevent accidental deletions, **versioning** is enabled for the bucket.

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "kooben_storage_bucket" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.kooben_storage_bucket.id

  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}
```

## **Logging Configuration** *(Optional, tfsec recommendation)*
Logging is enabled to store access logs within the same bucket under the `logs/` prefix, which is useful for auditing.

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_logging" "kooben_storage_bucket" {
  bucket        = aws_s3_bucket.kooben_storage_bucket.id
  target_bucket = aws_s3_bucket.kooben_storage_bucket.id
  target_prefix = "logs/"
}
```

## **Conclusion**
This configuration ensures that the S3 bucket used in the **Kooben** project is **secure, encrypted, and properly managed**. By implementing **customer-managed encryption, versioning, and strict public access controls**, the configuration aligns with AWS best practices and **tfsec security recommendations**.
