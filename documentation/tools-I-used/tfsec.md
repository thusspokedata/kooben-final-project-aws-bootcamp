# **Using tfsec for Terraform Security Scanning**

## **Why Use tfsec?**
tfsec is a static analysis security scanner for Terraform configurations. It helps identify security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations before deploying infrastructure, ensuring compliance with best practices and security standards.

## **Benefits of Using tfsec**
- **Security Best Practices:** Detects security issues in Terraform code before deployment.
- **Fast and Lightweight:** Runs quickly without requiring complex setup.
- **Continuous Integration:** Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated security checks.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Provides insights into detected vulnerabilities with severity levels.
- **Prevention Over Remediation:** Helps address security risks early in the development cycle.

## **Example: Running tfsec in a Terraform Project**
The following example demonstrates running `tfsec` on a Terraform project:

```sh
kilo@MacBookPro kooben-final-project-aws-bootcamp (main) % tfsec

======================================================
tfsec is joining the Trivy family

tfsec will continue to remain available
for the time being, although our engineering
attention will be directed at Trivy going forward.
